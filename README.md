Code relating to uplift modeling

1. Download data to ./datasets/
-http://ailab.criteo.com/criteo-uplift-prediction-dataset/
-https://blog.minethatdata.com/2008/03/minethatdata-e-mail-analytics-and-data.html

2. Extract data to .csv-file.
3. Install python requirements listed in requirements.txt (some might be unnecessary).
4. Create load_data.DatasetCollection object following instructions in load_data.py
5. Pick model from models, train and predict
6. Evaluate performance using uplift_metrics.UpliftMetrics class.

* ./data/ contains files related to data wrangling, with the class load_data.DatasetCollection being at the heart of everything.
* ./experiments/ contains code tying together data wrangling, models, and metrics into experiments run. Some of the results are published.
* ./metrics/ contains code for estimating metrics with the class uplift_metrics.UpliftMetrics estimating the most commonly used metrics in uplift modeling.
* ./models/ contains a wide selection of different uplift models, some published, some unpublished.
* ./slurm/ contains code for running parallel experiments on a cluster using the slurm workload manager
* ./tests/ contains a few tests with the most important one being a test for the metrics package.


## Publications
The following publications are based on the code in this repository:

## Notes
The code is mostly written by Otto Nyberg as part of my work on my dissertation at the University of Helsinki.
Tomasz Kusmierczyk has contributed to the code and Arto Klami has provided useful feedback.
The file experiments/dirichlet_gp.py requires an exotic environment (old version of python, ancient version of tensorflow etc.). Details for that might be provided later.
